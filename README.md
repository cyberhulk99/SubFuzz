## Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* pip for Python package installation
* Optional: Ollama for enhanced AI features

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cyberhulk99/SubFuzz.git
cd SubFuzz

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install Ollama for AI features
chmod +x install_ollama.sh
./install_ollama.sh
```

### Optional Components

1. **Nuclei Integration**: 
   - Follow official docs at `https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei`

2. **Ollama Setup (for AI features)**:
   - Automated: Use provided `install_ollama.sh`
   - Manual: Follow instructions at `https://ollama.ai`

3. **External Tools Integration**:
   - Place external tools in the `tools/` directory
   - Enable via appropriate CLI flags
   - See Integration Tips section for best practices

### Wordlists

You can use wordlists in two ways:

1. **Using Custom Wordlists (Recommended)**:
   - Use any wordlist directly with the `-w` flag:
     ```bash
     python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com -w /path/to/your/wordlist.txt
     ```
   - This gives you flexibility to use your preferred wordlists

2. **Default Wordlists (Optional)**:
   - The tool can also use wordlists from the `wordlists/` directory
   - For subdomain scanning: `wordlists/subdomains/`
   - For directory scanning: `wordlists/dirs/`
   - Example with default location:
     ```bash
     # If you want to use the default location, just place your list here:
     mkdir -p wordlists/subdomains
     cp your-wordlist.txt wordlists/subdomains/
     ```

Note: You're not limited to any specific wordlist. The tool is designed to work with any text-based wordlist through the `-w` flag.

## Roadmap & Coming Soon

üöÄ **Upcoming Features:**

* Advanced vulnerability assessment modules
* Enhanced smart rate limiting system
* Comprehensive security header analysis
* Automated reporting system
* Performance benchmarking
* Advanced AI features
* Scan resumption capability

These features are actively being developed. Stay tuned for updates!

## Usage

Basic usage patterns (run `python3 sfuzz.py -h` for full options):

```bash
# Recon only (passive + active) for example.com
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --recon

# Quick scan (brute-force + quick portscan)
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --quick

# Full penetration-style scan with AI enabled (deep mode will be auto-selected by --full-scan)
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --full-scan

# Use a custom wordlist for active bruteforce
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --wordlist wordlists/subdomains/custom.txt --active

# Save discovered subdomains to a file
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --recon -o discovered.txt
```

### Common flags

* `-d/--domain` ‚Äî Target domain
* `-u/--url` ‚Äî Single URL
* `-i/--input` ‚Äî File with a list of targets
* `--workers` ‚Äî Number of threads (default 30)
* `--timeout` ‚Äî Request timeout (seconds)
* `--ai-mode` ‚Äî One of `off`, `fast`, `smart`, `aggressive`, `deep`
* `--nuclei-scan` ‚Äî Enable Nuclei scanning (requires `nuclei` binary)

---

## AI / Ollama Integration

* SFUZZ will attempt to talk to a local Ollama service at `http://localhost:11434`.
* If Ollama is reachable and has models available, SFUZZ enables stronger AI-powered features: smarter wordlist selection and analysis.
* If Ollama is not installed or not running, SFUZZ will fall back to the built-in heuristic AI and still run.

**Enabling AI features:**

* Install Ollama and pull models (see `install_ollama.sh` or manual install).
* Ensure the Ollama service is running (`ollama serve`) and reachable at port `11434`.
* Run SFUZZ with `--ai-mode smart` (default), or choose `fast`, `aggressive`, or `deep`.

**If you do NOT want SFUZZ to try to auto-download or use AI models, run with:**

```bash
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --ai-mode off --no-ai-download
```

## Integration Tips

* Keep external tools in `tools/` and refer to them from the main script
* Use appropriate CLI flags to enable/disable integrations
* Follow modular design patterns for new integrations

---

## Notes & Best Practices

* Run this tool only against systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.
* Use `--stealth` to reduce request rate and lower detection footprint.
* Large scans may generate high network/target load ‚Äî consider throttling `--workers` and increasing `--timeout` for unstable targets.
* The tool attempts to be defensive: it treats any HTTP status < 500 as an indicator of a live host.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Ollama not starting:** Inspect `/tmp/ollama.log` (the installer writes logs there when starting `ollama serve`), and run `ollama serve` manually to view live output.
* **crt.sh or Wayback API failures:** Often transient ‚Äî try again or increase `--timeout`.
* **Nuclei CLI issues:** Ensure `nuclei` is in your `$PATH` and you have an up-to-date templates repository.
