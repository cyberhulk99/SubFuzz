## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Reconnaissance**
- **Intelligent Subdomain Discovery**: AI analyzes your domain and selects the most relevant subdomains to test
- **Smart Wordlist Curation**: Dynamically generates and selects subdomains based on domain context
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies enterprise patterns, tech stacks, and common subdomain structures

### 2. **Comprehensive Passive Intelligence**
- **10+ Passive Sources**: 
  - Certificate Transparency (crt.sh, CertSpotter)
  - Historical Data (Wayback Machine)
  - DNS Databases (BufferOverflow, HackerTarget)
  - Threat Intelligence (ThreatCrowd, SecurityTrails)
  - Specialized APIs (Anubis, SubdomainCenter)

### 3. **Massive Active Enumeration**
- **Tests 15,000-25,000+ Subdomains** based on AI mode
- **Multi-threaded DNS resolution** with 100+ concurrent workers
- **HTTP probing** to identify live hosts
- **Recursive discovery** with configurable depth

### 4. **Advanced Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Nuclei Integration**: Full Nuclei template scanning
- **Port Scanning**: Comprehensive port discovery
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Technology stack analysis and vulnerability prediction
- **Real-time Results**: Color-coded severity reporting

### 5. **Multiple AI Modes**
- **Fast**: Quick essential checks (10K subdomains)
- **Smart**: Balanced approach (15K subdomains) 
- **Aggressive**: Maximum coverage (25K subdomains)
- **Deep**: Comprehensive analysis with AI insights
