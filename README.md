This repository contains:

* `sfuzz.py` ‚Äî main Python script (the tool you provided)
* `install_ollama.sh` ‚Äî Ollama auto-installer (bash)
* `wordlists/` ‚Äî subdomain and directory wordlists
* `README.md` ‚Äî this document
* `tools/` ‚Äî optional external tools and integrations (see below)

---

## New: SubFuzz Integration

SFUZZ can integrate with the external SubFuzz repository to provide additional subdomain bruteforce and fuzzing functionality. Clone SubFuzz into the `tools/` directory to keep integrations organized.

To add SubFuzz:

```bash
# from the repo root
mkdir -p tools
git clone https://github.com/sdicssh1999/SubFuzz.git tools/SubFuzz
```

After cloning, review `tools/SubFuzz/README.md` for SubFuzz-specific usage. You can optionally add wrappers in `sfuzz.py` to call SubFuzz as a subprocess when `--use-subfuzz` (or similar) flag is implemented.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` for Python packages
* Optional (recommended): `nuclei` installed and in `$PATH`
* Optional: `ollama` and one or more models (for AI features)

### Wordlists
The tool requires wordlists for effective scanning. Due to size constraints, large wordlists are not included in the repository. You can:

1. Download the Assetnote 2M subdomains wordlist (recommended):
```bash
mkdir -p wordlists/subdomains
wget -O wordlists/subdomains/2m-subdomains.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/assetnote/commonspeak2-wordlists/master/subdomains/subdomains.txt
# If wget is not available, use curl:
# curl -o wordlists/subdomains/2m-subdomains.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/assetnote/commonspeak2-wordlists/master/subdomains/subdomains.txt
```

This wordlist contains over 2 million unique subdomains gathered from various sources including:
- DNS datasets
- CommonCrawl data
- Certificate Transparency logs
- Web crawling results
- Public datasets

2. Or use your own custom wordlists by placing them in:
   - `wordlists/subdomains/` - for subdomain wordlists
   - `wordlists/dirs/` - for directory wordlists

Python dependencies (install with pip):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or individually:
pip install requests colorama beautifulsoup4 dnspython
```

Create a `requirements.txt` with at least:

```
requests
colorama
beautifulsoup4
dnspython
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd sfuzz
```

2. Install Python dependencies (see Prerequisites).

3. (Optional) Install `nuclei` by following the official docs (`https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei`).

4. (Optional) If you want AI features, install Ollama:

* Manual way: follow the instructions at `https://ollama.ai` for your OS.
* Automated: run the provided installer script `install_ollama.sh` (see **Ollama Installer** section below).

5. (Optional) Add integrations like SubFuzz:

```bash
# clone SubFuzz into the tools folder
mkdir -p tools
git clone https://github.com/sdicssh1999/SubFuzz.git tools/SubFuzz
```

---

## install_ollama.sh (Ollama Auto-Installer)

A helper script, `install_ollama.sh`, is included to simplify Ollama setup (it will not bypass the official install steps where required). Make the script executable and run it as root or with sudo:

```bash
chmod +x install_ollama.sh
sudo ./install_ollama.sh
```

**What the installer does (high level):**

* Checks whether `ollama` binary is present
* Attempts to start the Ollama service (via `brew services` on macOS if available, or `ollama serve` directly)
* Attempts to pull a list of models (defaults try `llama2` and `codellama`) using `ollama pull`
* Verifies the service is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`

> Note: Ollama distribution packaging and installation requires platform-specific steps (root permissions). The script guides you and provides manual steps if automatic install is not possible.

---

## Usage

Basic usage patterns (run `python3 sfuzz.py -h` for full options):

```bash
# Recon only (passive + active) for example.com
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --recon

# Quick scan (brute-force + quick portscan)
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --quick

# Full penetration-style scan with AI enabled (deep mode will be auto-selected by --full-scan)
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --full-scan

# Use a custom wordlist for active bruteforce
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --wordlist wordlists/subdomains/custom.txt --active

# Save discovered subdomains to a file
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --recon -o discovered.txt
```

### Common flags

* `-d/--domain` ‚Äî Target domain
* `-u/--url` ‚Äî Single URL
* `-i/--input` ‚Äî File with a list of targets
* `--workers` ‚Äî Number of threads (default 30)
* `--timeout` ‚Äî Request timeout (seconds)
* `--ai-mode` ‚Äî One of `off`, `fast`, `smart`, `aggressive`, `deep`
* `--nuclei-scan` ‚Äî Enable Nuclei scanning (requires `nuclei` binary)

---

## AI / Ollama Integration

* SFUZZ will attempt to talk to a local Ollama service at `http://localhost:11434`.
* If Ollama is reachable and has models available, SFUZZ enables stronger AI-powered features: smarter wordlist selection and analysis.
* If Ollama is not installed or not running, SFUZZ will fall back to the built-in heuristic AI and still run.

**Enabling AI features:**

* Install Ollama and pull models (see `install_ollama.sh` or manual install).
* Ensure the Ollama service is running (`ollama serve`) and reachable at port `11434`.
* Run SFUZZ with `--ai-mode smart` (default), or choose `fast`, `aggressive`, or `deep`.

**If you do NOT want SFUZZ to try to auto-download or use AI models, run with:**

```bash
python3 sfuzz.py -d example.com --ai-mode off --no-ai-download
```

---

## Integration Tips

* To call SubFuzz from SFUZZ, add a small wrapper function in `sfuzz.py` that runs SubFuzz with subprocess and captures output. Example pseudocode in Python:

```python
subfuzz_cmd = ["python3", "tools/SubFuzz/subfuzz.py", "-d", domain, "--wordlist", "wordlists/subdomains/custom.txt"]
proc = subprocess.run(subfuzz_cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=300)
# parse proc.stdout and add discovered subdomains to discovered_subdomains set
```

* Keep external tools in `tools/` and refer to them from the main script. Add CLI flags to enable/disable each integration.

---

## Notes & Best Practices

* Run this tool only against systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.
* Use `--stealth` to reduce request rate and lower detection footprint.
* Large scans may generate high network/target load ‚Äî consider throttling `--workers` and increasing `--timeout` for unstable targets.
* The tool attempts to be defensive: it treats any HTTP status < 500 as an indicator of a live host.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Ollama not starting:** Inspect `/tmp/ollama.log` (the installer writes logs there when starting `ollama serve`), and run `ollama serve` manually to view live output.
* **crt.sh or Wayback API failures:** Often transient ‚Äî try again or increase `--timeout`.
* **Nuclei CLI issues:** Ensure `nuclei` is in your `$PATH` and you have an up-to-date templates repository.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open issues/PRs for new integrations, bug fixes, or improvements. Keep PRs small and focused.

Suggested areas:

* Add support for ProjectDiscovery tools (subfinder, httpx, gau) as optional subprocess integrations
* Replace basic socket-based port scanning with `nmap`-driven scans for accuracy
* Improve result export formats (CSV/HTML/JSON)
